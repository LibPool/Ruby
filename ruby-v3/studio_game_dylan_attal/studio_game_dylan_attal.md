## 简介

## Studio Game Demo App

I made this app following along with The Pragmatic Studio's Ruby course found here: https://pragmaticstudio.com/courses/ruby.

## Install the gem

I published the gem for this app on RubyGems.org. In order to install it, run

`gem install studio_game_dylan_attal-1.0.0.gem`

## Run the app

In order to run the app run the following command

`studio_game`

## Summary

This is a console app that simulates a game.

Players are loaded from the `players.csv` file be default. Each player has a name and a starting health value, i.e.:

`Larry,100`

If the user wants, they can provide a different CSV file to load the players. For example, I've provided a file `my_favorite_players.csv` as an alternate list of players. The user should provide the file like so

`studio_game bin/my_favorite_players.csv`

Before the game is played, the user gets to decide how many rounds to play. At this point, the user can also terminate the program by typing in `quit` or `exit`:

`How many game rounds? ('quit to exit')`

Once the user provides the number of rounds, the game is played automatically. The user then sees

1. Which players are involved

```
There are 5 players in Knuckleheads:
I'm Boba with a health = 100, points = 0, and score = 100.
I'm Jango with a health = 90, points = 0, and score = 90.
I'm Din with a health = 80, points = 0, and score = 80.
I'm Klutz with a health = 105, points = 0, and score = 105.
I'm Berserker with a health = 50, points = 0, and score = 50.
```

2. Which treasures there are to find

```
There are 6 treasures to be found:
A pie is worth 5
A bottle is worth 25
A hammer is worth 50
A skillet is worth 100
A broomstick is worth 200
A crowbar is worth 400
```

3. The results of each round

## Rules of the game

Each round, each player rolls the die.

If a player rolls between 1 and 2, then they are `blammed`, meaning they lose `10 health`.

If a player rolls between 3 and 4, then they are `skipped`, meaning they do not gain or lose points that turn.

If a player rolls between 5 and 6, then they are `w00ted`, meaning they gain `15 health`.

Each round, players can find treasure worth different points. Treasures are found randomly.

Every game, there are two special players added:

1. `ClumsyPlayer`: this player's treasure points are cut in half.
2. `BerserkPlayer`: once this player is `w00ted` five times, it cannot be `blammed` in that game anymore&mdash;if this player rolls between 1 and 2, they are `w00ted` instead of `blammed`.
